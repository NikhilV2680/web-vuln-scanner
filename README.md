# 🌐 Web URL Scanner (Streamlit App)

This is a simple and useful **Streamlit app** that lets you scan multiple websites and check their status and basic security details.

## 🧠 What It Does

You paste in a list of URLs, and the app checks:

- ✅ If each site is reachable
- 🔒 Whether it uses HTTPS
- 🛠 What kind of server it’s running (like Apache or Nginx)
- 🤖 If there's a `robots.txt` file
- 📥 Lets you download the results as a CSV

It's quick, easy, and gives a nice overview of each site you scan.

## 🎯 Why I Made This

I created this project to learn more about web security and how websites work under the hood. It started as a personal project and turned into something actually useful.

It also helped me get more comfortable with:

- Using Streamlit for web apps
- Making HTTP requests and parsing responses
- Working with CSV data in Python
